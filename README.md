# time_tracking_app

This Flutter application offers a robust Kanban board for task management, enabling users to create, edit, and move tasks across different columns such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." It also integrates a timer feature that allows users to track the time spent on each task. Additionally, the app maintains a history of completed tasks and provides a commenting feature for each task to facilitate collaboration or personal notes.

Task management within the app is powered by the Todoist API, while local data storage is efficiently managed using Sqflite. The application is developed with a clean architecture approach, ensuring maintainability and scalability, and leverages the BLoC (Business Logic Component) state management technique to manage the app's state efficiently.
